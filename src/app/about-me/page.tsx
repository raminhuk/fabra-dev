                                    <p>Hi there! I&apos;m Fabio J. Raminhuk, a passionate frontend developer with a strong background in technology. Let me introduce myself and tell you more about my journey in the world of web development.</p><br/>

                                    <p>I was born in Salete, a charming town located in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil, where I spent my childhood surrounded by nature and a close-knit community. From an early age, I developed a curiosity for technology and a desire to understand how things work.</p><br/>

                                    <p>In addition to my love for coding, I have several hobbies that keep me balanced and energized. On weekends, you&apos;ll often find me on the soccer field, where I enjoy playing with friends and competing in local leagues. When I&apos;m not on the pitch, I unwind by immersing myself in the virtual worlds of video games, exploring new challenges and stories. I also prioritize my health and fitness by hitting the gym regularly, where I push myself to achieve new personal bests and stay active.
                                    </p>
